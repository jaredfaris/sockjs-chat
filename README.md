sockjs-chat
===========

Lame [SockJS](http://sockjs.org) chat demo, modified from the original to compare against SignalR.

Find the original project [here](https://github.com/cubiq/sockjs-chat).

Install SockJS, run the socket server:

	node server.js

Point your browser to index.html.

Enjoy.

This is just a personal exercise with SockJS (due to the lack of demos), of course, not ready for production.
